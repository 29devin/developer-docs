# 3DS2 Admin API Guide

3DS2 payments are fully supported via the Admin API to process the customer through an authentication flow, with the final transaction information and results provided back to your application.

:::info
Your store must have a 3DS2 enabled gateway to process 3DS2 transactions.
:::

### Step 1 - Create Order

When creating a new order using a 3DS2 enabled gateway, youâ€™ll need to use the `payment_method=bankcard` as well as provide a `payment_return_url`. The `payment_return_url` is your endpoint that will receive a POST request containing the final order data (in Step 3).

```json title="Payment Details for Order with 3DS2 Payment"
"payment_method": "bankcard",
"payment_details": {
    "card_token": "<card token>",
    "payment_return_url": "<YOUR APPLICATION ENDPOINT>"
}
```

### Step 2 - Redirect Customer to Payment Complete URL
The response from Step 1 will provide a payment_complete_url. Your application should redirect the customer to this URL for completing the payment authentication.

```json title="Response with Payment Complete URL"
{
    "reference_transaction_id": null,
    "payment_complete_url": "https://<domain>/payments/3ds-auth/?token=<transaction token>"
}
```


### Step 3 - Receive Order Data
```mdx-code-block

import RedirectPaymentStep3 from '@site/_snippets/_redirect-payment-flows-step-3.mdx';

<RedirectPaymentStep3 />

```
